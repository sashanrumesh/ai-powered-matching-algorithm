AI-Powered Matching Engine for Social Meetups
A sophisticated, end-to-end Machine Learning system that powers matchmaking for a social hobby application. This project demonstrates the development of a production-ready API that uses a hybrid weighted algorithm to connect users based on interests, location, demographics, and behavior.

✨ Features
🤖 Hybrid Matching Algorithm: Implements a custom weighted scoring system with four key dimensions:

Hobby Similarity (40%): Content-based filtering using collaborative filtering techniques

Location Proximity (30%): Distance-based scoring with exponential decay

Demographic Compatibility (20%): Age-based Gaussian similarity matching

Behavioral Signals (10%): Simulated user engagement and activity scoring

🌐 RESTful API: FastAPI backend with well-documented endpoints, ready for integration with any frontend

📊 Interactive Demo: Streamlit-based UI with Tinder-like swipe functionality and real-time visualizations

📈 ML Clustering: K-Means clustering for user segmentation and smart grouping

🔧 Cold Start Solution: Custom fake data generation for initial model training and testing

🚀 Deployment Ready: Docker configuration and AWS deployment guidelines included

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend Framework: FastAPI

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

Data Visualization: Streamlit, Plotly

Data Generation: Faker

Deployment: Docker, AWS EC2/Lambda

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip (Python package manager)

Installation
Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-matching-engine-social-meetup.git
cd ai-matching-engine-social-meetup
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Generate sample data

bash
python generate_data.py
Start the FastAPI server

bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
API will be available at http://localhost:8000

Interactive docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

Alternative docs: http://localhost:8000/redoc

Run the demo UI (in a new terminal)

bash
streamlit run demo_ui.py
Demo will be available at http://localhost:8501

📡 API Endpoints
Endpoint	Method	Description
/	GET	API health check
/match/users/{user_id}	GET	Get top user matches for a given user
/match/events/{user_id}	GET	Get recommended events for a user
/users/	GET	Get all users data (for demo purposes)
Example API Call
bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8000/match/users/5' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
🎯 How the Algorithm Works
The matching engine uses a weighted hybrid approach:

Hobby Similarity: Jaccard similarity coefficient on user hobbies

Location Proximity: Exponential decay based on Euclidean distance

Demographic Matching: Gaussian distribution around preferred age range

Behavioral Scoring: Simulated user engagement metrics

Final Score = (Hobby × 0.4) + (Location × 0.3) + (Demographics × 0.2) + (Behavior × 0.1)

🧪 Testing the System
Open the Streamlit demo at http://localhost:8501

Select a user profile from the sidebar

Click "Find Matches for Me!"

Swipe right (👍) or left (👎) on potential matches

Observe the real-time match scores and geographic visualization

🐳 Docker Deployment
bash
# Build the image
docker build -t matching-engine .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 matching-engine
Example Dockerfile
dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
